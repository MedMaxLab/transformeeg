    '''
    create_nested_kfold_subject_split creates a partition list to run a
    "nested subject-based k-fold cross validation". 

    Parameters
    ----------
    subj: int or list[int]
        The number of subjects of the dataset. It can be a list with the specific
        subject ids to use during the data partition.
    folds: int, optional
        The number of outer folds. It must be a positive integer. 
        Default = 10
    folds_nested: int, optional
        The number of inner folds. It must be a positive integer with value
        bigger than floor(subj-subj/folds).
        Default = 5
    start_with: int, optional
        The starting ID to use when creating the list of subject IDs. It will
        be considered only if subj is given as an integer. For example, if subj 
        is 10 and start_with is 5, the list of IDs to partition is 
        [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14].
        Default = 1
    seed: int, optional
        The seed to use during data partition. This will make results reproducible.
        Default = 83136297

    Returns
    -------
    partition_list: list
        The partition list. Each element in the list is a collection 
        of three lists, representing a specific partition. 
        The first contains the subjects IDs included in the training set,
        the second the subjects IDs included in the validation set,
        the third the subjects IDs included in the test set.
        Note that the length of the partition_list is outer_folds*inner_folds,
        and the partition at index i refers to the 
        mod(i+1, inner_folds) inner fold of the ceil((i+1)/outer_folds) outer fold.
