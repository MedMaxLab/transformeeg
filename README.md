# TransformEEG: Parkinson's Disease Detection with EEG data

This is the official repository for the research paper 

    TransformEEG: Towards Improving Model Generalizability in
    Deep Learning-based EEG Parkinson's Disease Detection

Submitted to Neurocomputing.

In this work, we propose TransformEEG, a hybrid Convolutional-Transformer
designed for PD detection using EEG data.
Unlike transformer models based on the EEGNet structure,
TransformEEG incorporates a depthwise convolutional tokenizer.
This tokenizer is specialized in generating tokens composed
by channel-specific features, which enables more effective feature mixing
within the self-attention layers of the transformer encoder.

## How was the model evaluated

The paper describes in the detail the experimental methodology. 
Here, we report a brief description of the key points.

## Data Preprocessing

To preprocess the selected datasets, we recommend reading and following the instructions in the [docs](https://github.com/MedMaxLab/eegprepro/blob/main/docs/2_DataPreparation.md) file.
These instructions explain how to download datasets from OpenNeuro and preprocess them with BIDSAlign.

### Model architecture

The architecture of the model is schematized in the following figure. <br>
A pytorch implementation can be found in the ``AllFnc/models.py`` file.

### Model Evaluation

To evaluate the proposed model, four public datasets comprising 290 subjects
(140 PD patients, 150 healthy controls) were harmonized and aggregated.
A 10-outer, 10-inner Nested-Leave-N-Subjects-Out (N-LNSO) cross-validation
was performed to provide an unbiased comparison against seven other
consolidated EEG deep learning models.

The list of EEG-DL models included in the comparison, sorter by their number of learnable parameters in
ascending order, is reported below.

* **xEEGNet**
* **EEGNet**
* **ShallowNet**
* **ATCNet**
* **EEGConformer**
* **DeepConvNet**
* **EEGResNet**

The following figure schematizes the N-LNSO CV procedure.

## Provided code

The scripts used to generate the results presented in the paper
are available in this repository, which is derived from the following
[GitHub repo](https://github.com/MedMaxLab/eegprepro)
associated with another study we published.


## Results

Performance metrics of each trained model are collected and organized in
the **ResultsTable.csv** file.
Due to the large number of training instances, model weights and results are not directly stored in this repository.
We plan to release them in zenodo.
